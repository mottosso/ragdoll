### Showcase

Let's catch up on a few highlights over the past 2 weeks.

**Instict**

Andrei got Ragdoll introduced to this beautiful thing.

**Rhinos**

Jason's working on a new tutorial for how to make self-walking quadrupeds.

### Quality of Life

Let's have some more, shall we? ðŸ¥³

<br>

#### Import Symmetry

Symmetry is now preserved on import.

For any character authored in a symmetrical pose, the Ragdoll Manipulator would let you operate on this character on both sides at once.

But until now, this symmetry was lost if at any point an import was made on a character was not symmetrical, such as an animated character.

This changes today!

<br>

#### Manipulator Deselect

With nothing selected, you now have access to the Solver in the Channel Box.

<br>

#### Clean Abort on Record

Almost rhymes. If recording takes too long and you hit the ESC key to cancel, Ragdoll no longer leaves a mess behind. It's clean!

<br>

#### Auto Cache

There is now an option to disable auto cache upon completed record.

This will let the simulation continue running after recording, using your newly recorded controls as input.

<br>

#### On-Location Pin

Whenever you make a new Pin Constraint, it would appear at the location of your animation. But now, it will appear wherever the simulated version of your animation is.

### Fixes

Some house cleaning of minor things that could sometimes trip you up.

<br>

#### Nested Namespaces and Import

Ragdoll is now happy to import physics onto any number of namespaces.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47274066/158017568-bed631c7-2d89-4bf7-861a-6d6d0bfb9a11.mp4


<br>

#### Animated Pose Space

The previous release broke any transition between `Local` and `World`, this has now been fixed.

<br>

#### Fix Unlink Solver

Linking two solvers is a non-destructive method of getting multiple characters to interact in the same scene. As it happens, you haven't been able to *unlink* until now.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47274066/158014792-49fd1fa7-b7c0-4253-bbc5-5e17de6f2f8f.mp4

<br>

#### Export without .rag

As it happens, the Import Options will only show you files that have a `.rag` extension. But! The *Export Options* would permit export of files without this extension.

As a result, it could appear as though nothing was exported. :(

This has now been fixed.

<br>

#### Euler Filter

To keep gimbal locks from happening in your recorded simulation, an "Euler Filter" could be automatically applied. This hasn't been the case so far, but has now been fixed.
